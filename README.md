Prof. Nisheeth Shrivastava



Developed Face Recognition app utilising pre-trained models, employing Edge‑Computing for efficiency, and enabling real‑time
sync through WiFi‑Direct.
• Fine‑tuned models, including FaceNet and ArcFace, utilised face embeddings with a custom loss function, ensured secure data
transfer and redundancy using checksum.
• Delivered accurate recognition, instant data synchronisation, reliable data integrity, and an intuitive user interface for seamless
attendance management.
implemented a highly scalable database management system for accurate nationwide attendance tracking.
